# GAME DESCRIPTION & THINGS THE USER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE GAME:
In Trivia Ladder, the player attempts to climb his/her way to the top of the ladder
without falling off by answering questions of different categories. There are two basic
categories of questions: INTERNATIONAL (language and geography questions) and SCIENCE (biology, chemistry,
and physics questions). At each rung of the ladder,
a category will be selected at random, and a multiple-choice question will be asked.
If the player types in the correct answer, and he/she will move up one rung. If he/she is wrong, the player will
move down a few rungs on the ladder depending on the level of difficulty he/she selected at the start of the
game. Players who select a harder difficulty will fall more rungs if they get a question wrong.
Questions will become progressively more difficult and drop down in difficulty as the player gets more questions wrong.
If the player makes it all the way to Rung 20, then he/she wins. If the player falls too far off the ladder (if rung_number is 0 or negative),
or takes too long to answer any question, then the player loses. If the player runs out of questions in a category,
a special EAGLE swoops in and gives the player the chance to either lose or win with one question.
The code itself makes use of classes for the question categories,
lists, dictionaries, a function for time, if/else statements, while and for loops, global variables, randomization, et cetera.
